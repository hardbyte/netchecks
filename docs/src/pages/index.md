## Quick start

The Netchecks operator is a Kubernetes operator that helps users verify network policies and connectivity within their clusters. By creating NetworkAssertions, users can automate and schedule network tests, making it easier to ensure the network is operating as expected.


### Prerequisites

Before installing the Netchecks operator, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster up and running
- Kubectl installed and configured to communicate with your cluster

### Installation

Install the `Netchecks` operator with:

```shell
kubectl create namespace netchecks
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/hardbyte/netchecks/raw/main/operator/manifests/deploy.yaml
```

Wait until the netchecks namespace is running a Deployment with a ready Pod:

```shell
kubectl wait Deployment -n netchecks -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=netchecks-operator --for condition=Available --timeout=90s
```

### Basic Usage

Create and apply your `NetworkAssertions` as any other Kubernetes resource.

For example a `NetworkAssertion` with a single rule that checks HTTP requests to the Kubernetes API should succeed:

```yaml
apiVersion: netchecks.io/v1
kind: NetworkAssertion
metadata:
  name: http-k8s-api-should-work
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    description: Assert pod can connect to k8s API
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        optional-label: applied-to-test-pod
  schedule: "@hourly"
  rules:
    - name: kubernetes-version
      type: http
      url: https://kubernetes/version
      verify-tls-cert: false
      expected: pass
      validate:
        message: Http request to Kubernetes API should succeed.
```

Once you have applied the `NetworkAssertion`, netchecks reacts by creating a `CronJob` in the
same namespace to schedule the test. After the first test has run Netchecks creates a `PolicyReport` resource with the same name in the same namespace as the `NetworkAssertion`.
